# BSUIR Labworks Repository: Fundamentals of Algorithmization and Programming

This repository contains my solutions for laboratory works in the "Fundamentals of Algorithmization and Programming" course at BSUIR (Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics).

All labworks are divided by educational terms (semesters). Each labwork consists of the problem statement in README file and my solution in **C/C++** language.

*This repository is actively maintained and will be updated as new labworks are completed.*
